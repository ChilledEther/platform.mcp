// Package scaffold provides utilities for generating project scaffolding,
// specifically GitHub Actions workflows and Dockerfiles.
//
// It follows a pure-logic approach where generation results in a set of
// file structures (path, content, permissions) rather than performing
// direct disk I/O.
