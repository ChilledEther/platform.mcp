# Implementation Plan: 001-core-foundation

**Branch**: `001-core-foundation` | **Date**: 2026-01-17 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-core-foundation/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-core-foundation/spec.md`

## Summary

The Core Foundation Library provides the essential file generation logic for GitHub Actions workflows. It is implemented as a pure Go library in `pkg/scaffold`, following a Core-First Architecture where logic is separated from I/O. The library returns structured data (Path, Content, Mode) to be consumed by both the CLI and MCP applications.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Go 1.25+
**Primary Dependencies**: `github.com/spf13/cobra` (CLI), `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` (MCP), Go `embed` package
**Storage**: N/A (Pure functions)
**Testing**: `go test` with table-driven tests
**Target Platform**: Linux, Docker (Alpine-based)
**Project Type**: Library (`pkg/`)
**Performance Goals**: < 100ms for typical configurations
**Constraints**: No side effects in `pkg/`, mandatory TDD
**Scale/Scope**: Initial foundation for Platform MCP

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

1. **I. Core-First**: Logic MUST be in `pkg/scaffold`, return data, no I/O. (PASS)
2. **II. TDD**: Red-Green-Refactor mandatory. (PASS)
3. **III. Modular**: Interface-based design for generators. (PASS)
4. **IV. Separate Artifacts**: Core used by both `cmd/platform` and `cmd/platform-mcp`. (PASS)
5. **V. Docker-First**: Multi-stage builds, Alpine-based. (PASS)
6. **VI. MCP Naming**: `verb_noun`, `snake_case`. (PASS)

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
